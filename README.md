This Repository holds files that work towards creating an application that acts as a To-Do List Software. It will be used for Web-based application, and will provide different unique tasks such as creating an assignment, deleting an assignment, updating an assignment, and viewing different assignmets.

The development of this project will follow an Agile Methodology, with a sprint plan of: Week 1 - Basic UI Home Widget displaying possible functions such as a creating, viewing, updating, and deleting events; Week 2 - Create Supporting widgets To display other functions such as a login system allowing users to create "accounts". This will allow for a main user to assign events to the other users; Week 3 - Finishing Data Base Creation, creating two data bases, one for users and one for events. We will also complete any final connective steps for smooth application running;
